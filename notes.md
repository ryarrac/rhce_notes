### GNOME Desktop

In RHCSA exam, the candidate needs to know about GNOME desktop. However, I am not going to discuss all those. Instead, I am going to write few basic command lines which may be helpful.

|Command|Usability|

|Ctrl+Shift+N| New Terminal|
|Ctrl+D| Close newly opened terminal|
|Alt+Tab| Navigate between Terminals|
|Ctrl+Alt+â†’| Next workspace|

|Alt+F2| Run application|
